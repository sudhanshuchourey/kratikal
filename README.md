Employee Management System to get employee experience and location.

Technology Used:PHP,MYSQL,HTML5,CSS,Jquery,Bootstrap,Ajax

How i can improve this further : I can add some more field like joining date, salary, monthly leave and attendance system in this also can use otp for login 

What are current limitations and how to improve that: current limitations in dashboard limited graph can add multiple graph according to location and also can add individual employee performance for better understanding.

Performance : we can use encryption and access based restrictions also can use Aws, CDN  for improving performance 

Responsiveness: we can create a fresh UI with better responsiveness 

How i can create similar stuff using node and react: yes can work to deploy this on Node + React using CURD but it will take time, as I have limited resources.
